# Data sport visualisation 🏃‍♂️🏋️‍♀️

## Motivation for the work
I am passionate about sports (football, tennis, badminton...). Since 2020, I started running and I want to improve my speed and endurance in the long term. Then, I acquired theoretical knowledge about running. I noted that to progress without injury, it's essential to build a training program that aligns with the idea of **gradual progression** 📈. 

I had to choose between two options:
- Be followed by a sports coach who prepares my training program.
- Build some tools to monitor my progression.

I chose the second option, as I can use my programming skills and my personal data collected by my sports watch (also this alternative is free...).

## Content of the repository

This repo contains:

### 1 – Personal sports data (*sport_data2023.xlsx*) 🏃‍♂️🏋️‍♀️

I manually stored my personal data (running, workout and other activities) in the Excel file.
- In the *RUNNING* sheet, I mention every jogging session with its main characteristics (date, distance, intensity zones, elevation gain). 
- The *WORKOUT* sheet details the duration of every workout session (upper body, abs, lower body). 
- Finally, the *OTHER* sheet provides other activities with a relatively important physical activity expenditure.

I chose to add workout and other data because they can impact (positively or negatively) my physical fitness and health.

### 2 – Data Visualisation (*graphs.ipynb*) 📊

I made a Jupyter Notebook that visualises my sports data. More precisely, it provides 3 graphs :
- A daily overall graph.
- A weekly running graph.
- A weekly workout graph.

These tools help me visualize data and adjust my training program accordingly.

### 3 –  A *generated_graphs* folder 📁

This folder contains the 3 graphs generated by the Notebook.

## 📌 Note

As I started developing these tools in 2024, the data provided here is virtual and not based on my personal activities.
